# Magic8Ball
This is a Magic 8 Ball program written in PHP which prompts the user to input a yes or no question and gives the user an answer. I'm new to PHP and this was a fun activity from Codecademy to practice conditional statements. I added a bit of my own flare to the program, but for the most part, it is a classic Magic 8 Ball program. 

I enjoyed this activity and decided to save it as a reminder of my first week learning PHP. I hope to return to this repository in the future when I am more experienced with PHP to remind myself how far I've come. As for now, I'm enjoying learning this new language and looking forward to growing my skills in backend engineering.
